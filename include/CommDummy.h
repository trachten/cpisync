 * This communicant communicates to and from a queue of characters. The queue is external so it can be used as
 * a shared resource between two CommDummys. This communicant is meant for use in tests/unit/CommunicantTest.cpp;
 * as such, it has not been integrated as a formal communicant with GenSync.
