/**
 * Implements a hash layer on top of an existing sync algorithm (subclass of SyncMethod).

 * 0.  All entries are hashed, and an inverse hash is maintained by the object.
 * 1.  Synchronization occurs based on hashes, utilizing the templated sync algorithm.
 * 2.  After synchronization of hashes, another synchronization exchange occurs to translate
 *      hashed entries into actual objects.
