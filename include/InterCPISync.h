 * Implements a data structure for interactively synchronizing sets of
 * data.  The expected amount of communication and computation is linear in the
 * number of differences between the sets, and logarithmic in the overall size of the
 * sets.
 * 
 * This data structure is also designed to allow interruption ... meaning that differences
 * are exchanged as they are encountered, so that an interrupted sync can be continued
 * fairly quickly.  This also means that sets may be updated even if the overall sync fails.

     *    cannot store more than 1^bits elements.

     *    is upper bounded by 2^-epsilon.  Must be non-negative.

     *    in the union of the two sets that are being synchronized.

     *          so the constituent sync error probability enforced is much lower than the overall interactive sync.

     * @param partition The number of subspaces to partition a subset if synchronization fails.
     *     Must be >= 2 and <2^bits
