/*
 * The IBLTSync sync method syncs with another IBLTSync by sending an IBLT containing
 * its set. Upon receiving this IBLT, the server performs a subtract operation on both IBLTs
 * and uses the resulting IBLT to calculate the symmetric set difference. These differences
 * are then sent back to the client (in the case of a two-way sync), or not communicated (one-way sync).
 *
 * There is a small probability that most, but not all, of the differences will be uncovered as a result
 * of this sync.
